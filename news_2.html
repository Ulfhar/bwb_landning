        <h1 class="news-title">DevLog #1: Achievements and Lore</h1>

        <p class="news-subtitle"><em>Reminder: you’re reading a DevLog — thoughts and reflections from the developer of Far-Far Forest. No AI or GMO — just hand-made.</em></p>

        <section class="news-content">
            <p>Your game — your achievements. Has a nice ring to it, doesn’t it?</p>
            <p>Looking back, the decision to create my own achievement system was pretty spontaneous.</p>
            <p>For some reason, I just didn’t like the default Play Market achievements — too monotonous, too boring.</p>
            <p>Besides, it seemed like a fairly simple task I could complete quickly to take a short break from level design and focus on something else.</p>
            <p>And for once, my estimate turned out to be spot on (that doesn’t happen often, does it?).</p>
            <p>So what do we have now?</p>

            <figure class="news-image news-image-original-ratio">
                <img src="images/ach_menu.png" alt="Achievements menu in Far-Far-Forest" />
                <figcaption>A new row in the menu</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>First of all, my own flexible system with two types of achievements: ones that you need to accumulate to unlock, and ones that are granted immediately.</p>
            <p>The pop-ups turned out quite charming, and the overall design fits perfectly with the game’s atmosphere.</p>

            <figure class="news-image news-image-original-ratio">
                <img src="images/ach_screen.png" alt="Achievement screen with details" />
                <figcaption>Now it looks so. First one in the list with a green progress bar</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>I also had an idea: what if, when you unlocked an achievement, you’d get a little piece of the world’s lore?</p>
            <p>Because believe me — there’s so much to tell!</p>
            <p>But I couldn’t find a convenient or intuitive way to pull it off.</p>
            <p>I thought about adding it to the description, but since you can read that even without unlocking the achievement, the idea fell apart.</p>

            <p>A few words about the lore — and the pain that comes with it.</p>
            <p>I don’t know how to share it with you!</p>
            <p>Or rather, I don’t know how to do it the way I want.</p>
            <p>Because this text is for the “chosen ones,” those who are truly interested — so I’ll reveal a few cards (God, how that word sounds so filthy in the context of recent events).</p>

            <blockquote>
                In the Far-Far Forest, full of wonders and magic, there once lived a King — the Wise Oak.<br><br>
                His rule was honest and just, yet, as it often goes, not everyone shared his virtues. Even in a fairy tale.<br><br>
                Deep in the woods, beneath the mountain, grew the one whose cunning and bitterness brought an end to the ancient order.<br><br>
                There is no more Oak — Chestnut now reigns. And those who could still stand against his evil will are no more.<br><br>
                Little fireflies, who once gifted their light and strength to the Wise Ruler, now hide from the tyrant’s minions — the forest shadows, echoes of a life long past. They’re snatched into ancient lanterns and thrown without will under the roots of the Father of Thorny Fruits — the Great Chestnut.<br><br>
                How long will this silent oppression of Evil Will last? Yes, far too long.<br>
                Will it last forever? No, for a new Light has already been born that will overcome the Darkness.
            </blockquote>

            <p>This is just a fragment of the story that’s bursting to be told, and I have to find a way to share it with you.</p>
            <p>I don’t want to shove it in your face, but I don’t want to hide it away completely either.</p>
            <p>Anyway, this was supposed to be a text about achievements, and I got a little carried away.</p>
            <p>But what else is there to say?</p>
            <p>They’re here.</p>
            <p>I made them the way I saw fit — and that’s already something.</p>
            <p>Now I’m waiting for your feedback.</p>
