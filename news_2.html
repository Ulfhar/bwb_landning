        <h1 class="news-title">DevLog #1: Achievements</h1>

        <p class="news-subtitle"><em>Reminder: you’re reading a DevLog — thoughts and reflections from the developer of Far-Far Forest. No AI or GMO — just hand-made.</em></p>

        <section class="news-content">
            <p>Your game — your achievements. Sounds pretty good, doesn’t it?</p>
            <p>The decision to create my own achievement system, as I recall now, was spontaneous.</p>
            <p>For some reason, I simply didn’t like how the Play Market achievements looked — monotonous and dull.</p>
            <p>Besides, it seemed like a pretty simple task that could be done quickly and would let me take a short break from level design to focus on something else.</p>
            <p>And this time, the estimate was actually quite successful (which doesn’t happen often, does it?).</p>
            <p>So, what do we have now?</p>

            <figure class="news-image news-image-original-ratio">
                <img src="images/ach_menu.png" alt="Achievements menu in Far-Far-Forest" />
                <figcaption>A new row in the menu</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>First of all, my own flexible system with two types of achievements: those that need to be accumulated to unlock and those that are granted immediately.</p>
            <p>Pretty cute pop-ups and an overall design that fits well into the general atmosphere.</p>

            <figure class="news-image news-image-original-ratio">
                <img src="images/ach_screen.png" alt="Achievement screen with details" />
                <figcaption>Now it looks like this. First one in the list with a green progress bar</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>There was also an idea to make it so that when you unlock an achievement, you’d get a small piece of the world’s lore.</p>
            <p>Because believe me — there’s a lot to tell!</p>
            <p>But I couldn’t find a convenient and intuitive way to do it.</p>
            <p>I thought about adding it to the description, but you can read that even if you haven’t earned the achievement, so that idea didn’t work out.</p>

            <p>A few words about the lore and the pain that comes with it.</p>
            <p>I don’t know how to tell it to you!</p>
            <p>Or rather, I don’t know how to do it in the way I intended.</p>
            <p>Since this text is for the “chosen ones,” those who are truly interested, I’ll reveal a few cards (God, how the word “cards” sounds so vile in the context of recent events).</p>

            <blockquote>
                In the Far-Far Forest, full of wonders and magic, there once lived a King — the Wise Oak.<br><br>
                His reign was honest and just, yet, as it often happens, not everyone shared those virtues. Even in a fairy tale.<br><br>
                Deep in the woods, beneath the mountain, grew the one whose cunning and resentment put an end to the ancient order.<br><br>
                There is no more Oak — Chestnut now reigns. And those who could still defy his wicked will are no more.<br><br>
                Little fireflies, who once gave their light and strength to the Wise Ruler, now hide from the tyrant’s minions — the forest shadows, echoes of a life long past. They are snatched into ancient lanterns and thrown without will under the roots of the Father of Thorny Fruits — the Great Chestnut.<br><br>
                How long does this silent oppression of Evil Will last? Yes, far too long.<br>
                Will it last forever? No, for a new Light has already been born that will overcome the Darkness.
            </blockquote>

            <p>This is just a part of the story that’s bursting to come out, and I have to tell it to you somehow.</p>
            <p>I don’t want to do it “in your face,” but I also don’t want to hide it too much.</p>
            <p>In any case, this was supposed to be a text about achievements, and I got a little carried away.</p>
            <p>But what more can I say about them?</p>
            <p>They’re here.</p>
            <p>I made them the way I saw it — and that’s already cool.</p>
            <p>Now I’m waiting for feedback.</p>
